## Assignment 1 - image classification
### image classification pipeline  
##### 1. The images are divided into three datasets: train, validation, and test. Due to time constraints, only 120 images are taken for each category in the train dataset for training purposes.  
##### 2. Read each of the three datasets, perform image feature extraction using HOG, and store the resulting features as np.arrays.  
##### 3. Perform classification using K-NN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVC, and adaBoost respectively.
